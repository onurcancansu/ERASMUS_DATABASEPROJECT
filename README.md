# ERASMUS_DATABASEPROJECT

This project aims to alleviate the difficulties faced by students participating in the Erasmus program, particularly in terms of finding suitable accommodation and facilitating socialization. The project involves creating and managing a database using Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL).

**Features**
Accommodation Management: The database allows students to search for available accommodation options based on their preferences, such as location, price range, amenities, and roommates.
Reservation System: Students can reserve their preferred accommodation through the database, reducing the administrative burden and ensuring a streamlined process.
User Profiles: Each student has a profile in the database, containing their personal information, contact details, and preferences. This enables personalized recommendations and efficient communication.
Socialization Features: The database provides a platform for students to connect with each other, join social events and participate in various activities to enhance their social experience during the Erasmus program.

**Database Schema**
The database schema consists of the following main entities:

Students: Stores information about each student participating in the Erasmus program, including their name, email, contact details, and preferences.
Accommodations: Contains details about available accommodations, such as location, price, amenities, and roommate preferences.
Reservations: Manages the reservation process, linking students with their chosen accommodations.
Events: Stores information about social events and other activities that students can participate in to enhance their socialization experience.
The relationships between these entities are defined through appropriate primary and foreign key constraints.
